# Kitchen Roadmap — Agent Index

Planned features and initiatives across all repositories.
Add this file's path to your repo's `CLAUDE.md` to align implementation work with what is planned or in progress on the backend.

```
/Users/cdeachaval/learn/kitchen/docs/plans/AGENT_INDEX.md
```

**Audience key**: `B2C` = kitchen-mobile · `B2B` = kitchen-web · `Backend` = kitchen (this repo) · `Cross-repo` = coordination required across two or more repos

> Before building a feature, check this index for an existing roadmap doc. If one exists, read it — it likely contains schema decisions, API contracts, and sequencing constraints that affect your implementation.

---

## Cross-Repo — Requires Coordination

These features have work items in multiple repos. Read the roadmap doc before starting implementation on any side.
