# Database Persistence & Migration Guide

## **Two Paths: Migrate vs Rebuild**

| Path | Command | When to use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Migrate** | `bash app/db/migrate.sh` | Incremental schema changes — preserves existing data |
| **Dev full rebuild** | `bash app/db/build_dev_db.sh` | New dev machine, or full reset including demo-day data (dev only) |
| **Primitive rebuild** | `bash app/db/build_kitchen_db.sh` | Schema + reference + dev fixtures only — no demo data; used by future staging/prod compositions |

**Default to migrate.** Only rebuild when you need a fresh start. For dev, prefer `build_dev_db.sh` over `build_kitchen_db.sh` standalone — it includes the demo data that every dev session relies on.

## **Key Principle: All Changes Must Be in Repository Files**

Schema changes are made via **migration files** (`app/db/migrations/NNNN_description.sql`), then also applied to `schema.sql` so both paths stay in sync.

## **Database Structure Files**

## **Build Process Integration**

### **Incremental Migrations (preferred)**

```bash
bash app/db/migrate.sh
```

Applies only pending migrations from `app/db/migrations/`. Each migration runs in a transaction. Applied versions are tracked in `core.schema_migration`.

Environment modes (`ENV` variable):
- `dev` (default) — applies all migrations
- `staging` — applies all migrations; rejects none (staging gets same schema as dev)
- `production` — blocks destructive statements (DROP TABLE, TRUNCATE, ALTER TYPE)

### **Full Rebuild (clean slate) — dev daily driver**

```bash
# Requires: API running (bash scripts/run_dev_quiet.sh in a separate terminal)
#           PAYMENT_PROVIDER=mock in your .env
PAYMENT_PROVIDER=mock bash app/db/build_dev_db.sh
```

`build_dev_db.sh` is the recommended rebuild command for local dev. It sequences two scripts:

1. `build_kitchen_db.sh` — schema + reference + dev fixtures (the primitive, see below).
2. `scripts/load_demo_data.sh` — demo-day dataset: `demo_baseline.sql` (Layer A) + Newman `900_DEMO_DAY_SEED` (Layer B) + billing backfill (Layer C).

After `build_dev_db.sh` completes the DB contains everything the team expects during demos and local sessions: schema, reference data, dev fixtures, and all demo users, restaurants, plans, subscriptions, and order history.

**Why demo data is part of the dev rebuild:** skipping the demo-data step after every schema reset is what caused the demo-day incident. Demo data is now canonical for dev. It is explicitly excluded from staging/prod (the primitive script enforces this).

**Future staging/prod compositions** will call `build_kitchen_db.sh` directly (never `build_dev_db.sh`) and apply their own seed or data-migration steps separately.

The GCP dev-rebuild workflow (forthcoming, separate PR in infra-kitchen-gcp) will call `build_dev_db.sh` for the dev environment.

### **Primitive Rebuild (schema + reference + dev fixtures only)**

```bash
bash app/db/build_kitchen_db.sh
```

Loads, in order:
```
DROP all schemas CASCADE → schema.sql → index.sql → trigger.sql →
archival_config_table.sql → archival_indexes.sql → seed/reference_data.sql
→ seed/dev_fixtures.sql (dev only) → baseline schema_migration rows
```

The primitive script is the reusable building block. It accepts `ENV=staging` to skip dev fixtures. Use it when:
- You need schema + reference data without demo data (e.g., a worktree session, CI, or building a future staging/prod composition).
- You are inside a worktree — the TEMPLATE-clone fast path skips Newman, which is not safe to run concurrently.

Set `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, and `PGPASSWORD` for non-local targets (e.g. Cloud SQL). For CI/GCP without a venv or static assets, use `SKIP_PYTEST=1` and `SKIP_IMAGE_CLEANUP=1` (see comments in the script). Air-gapped CI or no outbound HTTP: set `SKIP_POST_REBUILD_SYNC=1` to skip FX and holiday API calls after the final seed.

### **Post-rebuild external sync (FX + national holidays)**

After the **final** `seed.sql` pass, `build_kitchen_db.sh` runs `app/db/post_rebuild_external_sync.py` (when a venv exists and `SKIP_POST_REBUILD_SYNC` is unset). This step:

- Updates `credit_currency_info.currency_conversion_usd` from **open.er-api.com** (non-USD rows; seed placeholders are `1.0` until then).
- Inserts **national_holidays** from **date.nager.at** (Nager.Date) for market countries in app config.

**Safety:** The script always exits successfully so a failed or blocked network does not abort the rebuild. It performs a short connectivity check per host before calling each API (avoids long timeouts when firewalled). Log lines are prefixed with `[post-rebuild-sync]` for grepping build logs.

**Env:** If you use `PGPASSWORD` for `psql` but not `DB_PASSWORD`, the script copies `PGPASSWORD` to `DB_PASSWORD` so `psycopg2` matches the same database.

**Manual run** (from repository root): `PYTHONPATH=. python app/db/post_rebuild_external_sync.py` — `PYTHONPATH=.` is required so `from app....` imports resolve.

You can instead run the same SQL files with `psql -f` (also from repo root); add `-v ON_ERROR_STOP=1`. The script’s initial `DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE` gives a clean slate; the raw `-f` chain does not unless you run that separately.

### **What Happens on Rebuild**
1. ✅ **Schema**: All tables created (enums stored on entities, no status_info/transaction_type_info)
2. ✅ **Indexes**: Standard indexes + 15 archival performance indexes
3. ✅ **Triggers**: History logging triggers
4. ✅ **Data**: Reference data from seed.sql
5. ✅ **Tests**: Pytest runs database integration tests
6. ✅ **Post-rebuild sync**: Optional FX + holiday fetch (see subsection above; skipped if no venv or `SKIP_POST_REBUILD_SYNC=1`)

### **IAM admin grants (`schema.sql` tail)**

`app/db/schema.sql` ends with a conditional block that grants full access on `public` tables, sequences, and functions to the Cloud SQL IAM role `viandallc@gmail.com` when that role exists in the cluster (so local rebuilds without that role skip it with no error).

**Note:** `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` only applies to objects created later **by the role that executes** those `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES` statements (often your migration/schema superuser). That matches the usual “admin user gets defaults from the account that builds the schema” pattern; if you ever need defaults for objects created by a different role, that would need a separate `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE ...`.

## **🚨 Critical Changes Made Persistent**

### **1. Archival Performance Indexes (15 total)**
```sql
-- Orders (vianda_pickup_live)
idx_vianda_pickup_archival, idx_vianda_pickup_archival_eligible

-- Transactions (restaurant_transaction)
idx_restaurant_transaction_archival, idx_restaurant_transaction_archival_eligible

-- Client transactions
idx_client_transaction_archival, idx_client_transaction_archival_eligible

-- Subscriptions, User, Restaurant
idx_subscription_archival, idx_subscription_archival_eligible
idx_user_archival, idx_user_archival_eligible
idx_restaurant_archival, idx_restaurant_archival_eligible

-- Statistics
idx_vianda_pickup_stats, idx_restaurant_transaction_stats, idx_client_transaction_stats
```

### **2. Archival Configuration**
Archival is configured in `app/config/archival_config.py` via `TABLE_CATEGORY_MAPPING` and `ArchivalCategory`. Tables are assigned retention periods by category (e.g. FINANCIAL_CRITICAL, CUSTOMER_SERVICE). Retention periods and grace periods are defined in `CATEGORY_SLA_CONFIG`.

### **3. Reference Data**
Status and transaction-type values are stored as PostgreSQL enums on entities (e.g. `status_enum`, `transaction_type_enum` in schema.sql). No separate status_info or transaction_type_info tables.

## **🔍 Validation After Rebuild**

### **Quick Verification Commands**
```bash
# 1. Verify archival indexes exist
psql -d kitchen -c "
SELECT count(*) FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE indexname LIKE '%archival%' OR indexname LIKE '%stats%';"
# Expected: 15

# 2. Verify core tables exist
psql -d kitchen -c "
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_name IN ('user_info', 'vianda_pickup_live', 'client_transaction', 'restaurant_info');"
# Expected: 4 rows

# 3. Run database tests
source venv/bin/activate && pytest app/tests/database/ -v --tb=short
```

### **Application Verification**
```python
# Test archival config loads
from app.config.archival_config import get_archival_priority_order, get_table_archival_config

tables = get_archival_priority_order()
print(f"Archival config: {len(tables)} tables")

# Verify a table has config
config = get_table_archival_config("vianda_pickup_live")
assert config.retention_days > 0
```

## **Demo Data (Third Layer)**

Kitchen has a third seed layer on top of reference data and dev fixtures: an opt-in, narrative dataset that populates restaurants, plans, customers, and sample activity for stakeholder demos.

### Three-layer model

| Layer | File(s) | Loaded in | How |
|---|---|---|---|
| Reference (canonical) | `app/db/seed/reference_data.sql` | every env | always by `build_kitchen_db.sh` |
| Dev fixtures | `app/db/seed/dev_fixtures.sql` | dev only | `build_kitchen_db.sh` when `ENV=dev` |
| **Demo (opt-in)** | `app/db/seed/demo_baseline.sql` + `docs/postman/collections/900_DEMO_DAY_SEED.postman_collection.json` | dev only, opt-in | `bash scripts/load_demo_data.sh` |

Demo data is loaded by `build_dev_db.sh` (the dev daily driver) as its second step. It is **never** loaded by `build_kitchen_db.sh` or `migrate.sh`. Demo data does not affect the `kitchen_template` fingerprint used by worktree clones.

### Loading demo data

**Preferred (full rebuild + demo data in one command):**

```bash
# .env: PAYMENT_PROVIDER=mock + API running on :8000 (bash scripts/run_dev_quiet.sh)
PAYMENT_PROVIDER=mock bash app/db/build_dev_db.sh
```

**Demo data only (on a DB that already has schema + reference + dev fixtures):**

```bash
# .env: PAYMENT_PROVIDER=mock + API running on :8000
bash scripts/load_demo_data.sh
```

The loader has two targets — `local` (default, mock payments) and `gcp-dev` (deployed dev API + Stripe sandbox). Operational details, prerequisites, and failure modes for each live in **`DEMO_DAY_DATASET.md`** in this same folder.

The loader runs two layers in order:
1. **Layer A** — `demo_baseline.sql`: inserts the supplier institution, demo admin user, addresses, and institution entity directly via SQL (no API endpoint for these entities).
2. **Layer B** — Newman runs `900_DEMO_DAY_SEED.postman_collection.json` against the live API: upserts restaurants, QR codes, products, viandas, vianda-kitchen-days, and plans for all three markets (PE / AR / US); signs up and subscribes customers; sets up employer institutions and benefit-enrolled employees; runs one order per customer per market through the full pickup flow.

At the end, credentials are printed to stdout and written to `.demo_credentials.local` (gitignored).

For the full narrative — markets, institutions, restaurants, viandas, savings math, all credential tables, and known workarounds — read **`DEMO_DAY_DATASET.md`** in this same folder. That doc is the authoritative reference.

**Re-running:** Customer signups, subscriptions, and orders are NOT idempotent — they create new rows on each run. To reset: `bash scripts/purge_demo_data.sh && bash scripts/load_demo_data.sh`.

### Demo UUID scheme

All demo rows use UUIDs starting with `dddddddd-dec0-`. This prefix makes demo entities visually distinct and purgeable:

```
dddddddd-dec0-0001-XXXX-...   supplier institution / admin user / entity
dddddddd-dec0-0010-XXXX-...   addresses (entity office + restaurant)
```

Transactional rows (subscriptions, orders, reviews) get system-generated UUIDs — they are linked to demo users via `username LIKE 'demo.cliente.pe.%@vianda.demo'`.

### Credentials flow

- The demo super-admin password is generated at load time with `openssl rand -base64 18`.
- It is hashed (bcrypt, passlib) and stored in `core.user_info` before Newman runs.
- The password is passed to Newman as `--env-var demoAdminPassword=...`.
- It is printed at the end of `load_demo_data.sh` and saved to `.demo_credentials.local`.
- `.demo_credentials.local` is gitignored — never commit it.

### Env guards

`load_demo_data.sh` exits non-zero when:
- `ENV` is anything other than `dev`.
- `DB_HOST` contains `prod` or `staging`.

These are independent layers of defense: the SQL files also contain a `DO $$ ... RAISE EXCEPTION $$` guard that checks `current_database()` at psql execution time.

### Purging demo data

To remove all demo rows without rebuilding the DB:

```bash
bash scripts/purge_demo_data.sh
```

Deletes all rows matching UUID prefix `dddddddd-dec0-` (and canonical_key `DEMO_*` for entities keyed by canonical key) in child-first dependency order, wrapped in a single transaction. A partial failure rolls back completely.

## **Things to Never Do**

- **Never apply DDL directly** — changes will be lost on rebuild. Always use a migration file.
- **Never edit an already-applied migration** — write a new one instead.
- **Never use `build_kitchen_db.sh` to apply incremental changes** — use `migrate.sh` to preserve test data.
- **Never insert reference data only in `dev_fixtures.sql`** — reference data belongs in `reference_data.sql` (and a migration for existing DBs).

## **🎯 Rebuild Test Checklist**

After any database rebuild, verify:

- [ ] **15 archival indexes** created
- [ ] **Core tables** exist (user_info, vianda_pickup_live, client_transaction, etc.)
- [ ] **Database tests** pass: `pytest app/tests/database/`
- [ ] **Archival config** loads: `get_archival_priority_order()` returns tables
- [ ] **Admin endpoints** accessible at `/admin/archival/*` and `/admin/archival-config/*`

## **Adding Schema Changes**

When adding new features that require database changes:

1. **Write a migration** → `app/db/migrations/NNNN_description.sql` (next sequence number)
2. **Update schema.sql** → Apply the same DDL change so a fresh rebuild produces the same result
3. **New indexes** → Include in the migration; also add to `app/db/index.sql` or `app/db/archival_indexes.sql`
4. **New triggers** → Include in the migration; also add to `app/db/trigger.sql`
5. **Reference data** → Include INSERT in the migration (with `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`); also add to `app/db/seed/reference_data.sql`
6. **New entity archival** → Add table to `TABLE_CATEGORY_MAPPING` in `app/config/archival_config.py`

**Dual-write rule:** Migration files and `schema.sql` must never contradict each other. The migration is the source of truth for "how we got here"; `schema.sql` is the source of truth for "what the DB looks like now."

**Never edit an already-applied migration.** If you need to fix something, write a new migration.

---

## **Current Status**

All archival system changes persist across rebuilds. Migration system is in place for incremental schema changes.

- **15 archival indexes** in `app/db/archival_indexes.sql`
- **Category-based retention** via `app/config/archival_config.py`
- **Admin endpoints** at `/admin/archival/*` and `/admin/archival-config/*`
- **Migration tracking** via `core.schema_migration` table
- **Seed data split** into `reference_data.sql` (all envs) + `dev_fixtures.sql` (dev only)
